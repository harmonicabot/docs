## Overview

As a session creator, you can set up and manage Harmonica sessions to gather insights, facilitate discussions, and coordinate with groups. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating effective sessions.

## Creating your first session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Harmonica">
    Go to [harmonica.chat](https://harmonica.chat) and sign in to your account. If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to create one first.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to your dashboard">
    After signing in, you'll see your dashboard with an overview of your sessions and projects.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new session">
    You can create a session in several ways:
    - Use the "What do you want to find out?" input field on the dashboard
    - Click "Create Session" button
    - Browse and use a template for common use cases
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your session">
    Set up the key details:
    - **Topic**: What is this session about?
    - **Goal**: What do you want to achieve?
    - **Context**: Any background information participants should know
    - **Critical information**: Any important constraints or requirements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set visibility and options">
    Configure:
    - **Public/Private**: Who can see this session
    - **Visibility settings**: What results are visible to participants
    - **Cross-pollination**: Whether insights should be shared across sessions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and invite participants">
    Once configured, save your session and share the invitation link with participants.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session configuration

### Topic and goal

The **topic** is the main subject of your session. Be clear and specific:
- ✅ Good: "Gathering feedback on the new product design"
- ❌ Vague: "Product stuff"

The **goal** defines what you want to achieve:
- ✅ Good: "Identify the top 3 usability issues users encounter"
- ❌ Vague: "Get feedback"

### Context and critical information

**Context** provides background that helps participants understand the situation:
- Relevant history or previous discussions
- Current state of the project or topic
- Any relevant constraints or considerations

**Critical information** includes must-know details:
- Deadlines or time constraints
- Budget limitations
- Technical requirements
- Decision-making criteria

<Tip>
  Providing good context helps participants give more relevant and useful responses. Don't assume they know everything you know.
</Tip>

### Using templates

Templates provide pre-configured session setups for common use cases:
- Product feedback sessions
- Team retrospectives
- Research interviews
- Planning sessions

Browse available templates when creating a session to save time and ensure you're asking the right questions.

## Inviting participants

### Sharing the session link

Once your session is created, you'll get a shareable link. You can:
- Copy the link and share it via email, messaging, or other channels
- Send invitations directly through Harmonica (if available)
- Add participants directly to the session

### Best practices for invitations

- **Provide context**: Let participants know what the session is about and why their input matters
- **Set expectations**: Mention how long the session might take
- **Give a deadline**: If there's a time limit, communicate it clearly
- **Follow up**: Remind participants if needed, but don't be pushy

## Managing active sessions

### Monitoring participation

While a session is active, you can:
- See who has joined
- Monitor participation levels
- View real-time contributions (depending on settings)

### Adjusting settings

You can modify some session settings while it's active:
- Update visibility settings
- Add or remove participants
- Adjust goals or context if needed

<Warning>
  Be careful when modifying active sessions, as changes may affect participants' experience or the quality of results.
</Warning>

## Reviewing session results

After participants have contributed, Harmonica generates:

### Summary
An overview of key insights synthesized from all participants' contributions.

### Session recap
A detailed breakdown of the conversation, including:
- Individual responses
- Common themes
- Unique insights

### Custom insights
Additional analysis based on your session goals and the data collected.

### Similarity scores
If enabled, you can see how similar or different participants' responses are.

## Organizing sessions into projects

Sessions can be organized into **projects** or **workspaces** to:
- Group related sessions together
- Track progress over time
- Maintain context across multiple sessions
- Share access with team members

See our [Managing Projects](/guides/creators/managing-projects) guide for more details.

## Troubleshooting

### Participants can't access the session

- **Check the link**: Verify the invitation link is correct and hasn't expired
- **Visibility settings**: Ensure the session isn't set to private if you want external participants
- **Contact support**: If issues persist, reach out to [hello@harmonica.chat](mailto:hello@harmonica.chat)

### Low participation

- **Remind participants**: Sometimes a gentle reminder helps
- **Clarify the value**: Make sure participants understand why their input matters
- **Make it easy**: Ensure the session is accessible and the topic is clear

### Results not as expected

- **Review your goals**: Make sure your session goals are clear and achievable
- **Check context**: Ensure participants had enough information to provide useful responses
- **Iterate**: Consider running another session with adjusted questions or context
