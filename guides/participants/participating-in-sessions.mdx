## Using the conversation interface

Once you're in a session, you'll see a conversation interface where you can engage in a guided conversational survey.

### Starting a conversation

- The conversation will typically begin with a greeting and may ask initial questions
- You can start typing your responses in the input field
- Press Enter or click Send to submit your message

### What to expect

The conversation will:
- Ask questions related to the session topic
- Guide the discussion based on your responses
- Gather your thoughts and qualitative insights
- Help structure your contributions

<Tip>
  Be honest and thoughtful in your responses. The AI is designed to help synthesize insights from all participants, so your authentic input is valuable.
