## Using the chat interface

Once you're in a session, you'll see a chat interface where you can interact with the AI assistant.

### Starting a conversation

- The AI assistant will typically greet you and may ask initial questions
- You can start typing your responses in the chat input field
- Press Enter or click Send to submit your message

### What to expect

The AI assistant will:
- Ask questions related to the session topic
- Guide the conversation based on your responses
