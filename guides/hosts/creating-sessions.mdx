## Overview

As a host, you can set up and manage Harmonica sessions to gather insights, facilitate discussions, and coordinate with groups. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating effective sessions.

## Creating your first session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Harmonica">
    Go to [app.harmonica.chat](https://app.harmonica.chat) and sign in to your account. If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to create one first.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to your dashboard">
    After signing in, you'll see your dashboard with an overview of your sessions and projects. You'll see a welcome banner with the question "What do you want to find out?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start creating a session">
    You can create a session in several ways:
    - Type your objective in the "What do you want to find out?" input field on the dashboard and click "Create"
    - Click "Get Started" or "Create Session" button
    - Browse templates by clicking the "Templates" button for common use cases
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Design your session (Multi-step form)">
    You'll go through a step-by-step process:
    - **Step 1: Objective** - Summarize what you are trying to achieve through these interviews
    - **Step 2: Critical to gather** - Specify what kind of information or details you need from participant responses
    - **Step 3: Context** - Provide background to help the AI understand the purpose of your session (optional)
    - **Step 4: Session name** - Enter a clear session name that will be shared with participants
    
    You can review and edit all fields before proceeding.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refine your session">
    After completing the form, Harmonica will generate a conversational guide (prompt) for the survey. You can:
    - Review the generated prompt
    - Edit and refine it as needed
    - Generate new versions if you make changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure participant questions">
    Set up a pre-session form that participants will fill out before chatting:
    - Add custom questions (name, email, or custom fields)
    - Configure question types (short text, email, multiple choice, etc.)
    - Set which fields are required
    - Reorder questions as needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch and share">
    Once everything is configured, launch your session. You'll get a unique session link (format: `/chat?s={sessionId}`) that you can:
    - Copy and share via email, messaging, or other channels
    - Generate a QR code for easy sharing
    - Share directly with participants
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session configuration

### Objective

The **objective** summarizes what you are trying to achieve through the interviews. Be clear and specific:
- ✅ Good: "I want to understand user preferences on our new product features and identify which features are most valuable."
- ❌ Vague: "Get feedback"

### Critical to gather

**Critical to gather** specifies what kind of information or details you need from participant responses:
- ✅ Good: "Participants should provide examples of their workflows or describe challenges they face when using similar products."
- ❌ Vague: "Their thoughts"

This helps guide the conversation to focus on gathering the qualitative insights you need from participants.

### Context

**Context** provides background to help the AI understand the purpose of your session (this step is optional):
- Relevant history or previous discussions
- Current state of the project or topic
- Any relevant constraints or considerations
- Company or product background

<Tip>
  Providing good context helps the AI generate a better conversational guide and helps participants give more relevant responses.
</Tip>

### Session name

Choose a clear, descriptive name that will be shared with participants. This helps them understand what the session is about before they join.

### Using templates

Templates provide pre-configured session setups for common use cases:
- Product feedback sessions
- Team retrospectives
- Research interviews
- Planning sessions

Browse available templates when creating a session to save time and ensure you're asking the right questions.

## Inviting participants

### Sharing the session link

Once your session is launched, you'll get a unique session link in the format: `/chat?s={sessionId}`. You can:
- **Copy the link** - Click the "Copy link" button to copy the full URL to your clipboard
- **Generate QR code** - Click "QR code" to generate a QR code that participants can scan
- Share via email, messaging, or other channels

The link takes participants directly to the conversation interface where they can start their guided conversational survey.

### Participant pre-session form

Before participants start chatting, they'll fill out the pre-session form you configured:
- Default fields: Name and Email (optional)
- Custom questions you added during session creation
- Questions are shown in the order you configured

### Best practices for invitations

- **Provide context**: Let participants know what the session is about and why their input matters
- **Set expectations**: Mention how long the session might take
- **Give a deadline**: If there's a time limit, communicate it clearly
- **Follow up**: Remind participants if needed, but don't be pushy

## Managing active sessions

### Monitoring participation

While a session is active, you can:
- See who has joined
- Monitor participation levels
- View real-time contributions (depending on settings)

### Adjusting settings

You can modify some session settings while it's active:
- Update visibility settings
- Add or remove participants
- Adjust goals or context if needed

<Warning>
  Be careful when modifying active sessions, as changes may affect participants' experience or the quality of results.
</Warning>

## Reviewing session results

After participants have contributed, Harmonica generates:

### Summary
An overview of key insights synthesized from all participants' contributions.

### Session recap
A detailed breakdown of the conversation, including:
- Individual responses
- Common themes
- Unique insights

### Custom insights
Additional analysis based on your session goals and the data collected.

### Similarity scores
If enabled, you can see how similar or different participants' responses are.

## Organizing sessions into projects

Sessions can be organized into **projects** or **workspaces** to:
- Group related sessions together
- Track progress over time
- Maintain context across multiple sessions
- Share access with team members

See our [Managing Projects](/guides/hosts/managing-projects) guide for more details.

## Troubleshooting

### Participants can't access the session

- **Check the link**: Verify the invitation link is correct and hasn't expired
- **Visibility settings**: Ensure the session isn't set to private if you want external participants
- **Contact support**: If issues persist, reach out to [hello@harmonica.chat](mailto:hello@harmonica.chat)

### Low participation

- **Remind participants**: Sometimes a gentle reminder helps
- **Clarify the value**: Make sure participants understand why their input matters
- **Make it easy**: Ensure the session is accessible and the topic is clear

### Results not as expected

- **Review your goals**: Make sure your session goals are clear and achievable
- **Check context**: Ensure participants had enough information to provide useful responses
- **Iterate**: Consider running another session with adjusted questions or context
