## Overview

Templates provide pre-configured session setups so you can get started quickly without designing a session from scratch. Each template comes with a predefined objective, context, and conversational guide tailored to a specific use case.

## Browsing templates

When creating a new session, click the **Templates** button on the dashboard to browse available templates. Each template shows:

- **Icon** -- A visual identifier for the template category
- **Name** -- What the template is designed for
- **Description** -- A brief explanation of the use case

## Using a template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a template">
    Click on a template to select it. The template's pre-configured fields will be loaded into the session creation form.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and customize">
    The template pre-fills your session's objective, critical-to-gather information, and context. Review these fields and adjust them to match your specific needs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine the prompt">
    The AI-generated conversational guide will be based on the template's defaults. You can edit and refine it just like any other session.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure and launch">
    Set up your participant questions, then launch and share as usual.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Templates are starting points -- feel free to modify any field to better fit your situation. The template just saves you from starting with a blank form.
</Tip>

## Common template types

Harmonica includes templates for a variety of use cases:

- **Product feedback** -- Gather user opinions on features, workflows, or product direction
- **Team retrospectives** -- Reflect on what went well and what to improve
- **Research interviews** -- Conduct structured qualitative research
- **Planning sessions** -- Align a group around goals and next steps
- **Stakeholder input** -- Collect perspectives from diverse stakeholders
- **Workshop facilitation** -- Run guided discussions on specific topics

## Chain templates

Chain templates link multiple sessions together into a workflow, where the output of one session feeds into the next.

### How chains work

1. A chain template defines a sequence of sessions (e.g., "Brainstorm" -> "Prioritize" -> "Plan")
2. When you create a session from a chain template, the first session in the chain is created
3. After the first session completes, you can continue to the next step in the chain
4. Results from previous sessions are automatically injected as context into subsequent sessions

### Context flow between sessions

Chain templates configure how results flow between steps:

- **Previous summary** -- The summary from the immediately preceding session is included as context
- **All summaries** -- Summaries from all preceding sessions are included
- **Custom** -- A custom configuration defines what context is carried forward

<Note>
  Chain templates are useful for multi-phase processes where you want participants' input to build on previous rounds of discussion.
