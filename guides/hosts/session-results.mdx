## Overview

After participants contribute to your session, Harmonica automatically synthesizes their conversations into actionable results. This guide covers how to navigate, manage, and export your session results.

## Result tabs

Your session results page has several tabs:

### Summary

The **Summary** tab shows an AI-generated synthesis of all participant conversations. It highlights key themes, common viewpoints, and notable insights across all responses.

- Summaries are generated in real time -- you don't need to wait for the session to end
- A color indicator shows the summary status:
  - **Green** -- up to date
  - **Yellow** -- currently updating
  - **Gray** -- needs update (new conversations have come in since the last summary)

<Tip>
  If participants are still contributing, the summary will automatically update as new conversations come in.
</Tip>

### Responses

The **Responses** tab lists all participant submissions. For each participant, you can see:

- Their pre-session form answers
- Completion status
- Timestamps

### Chat

The **Chat** tab shows the full conversation logs from all participants. You can read through individual conversations to see the detailed exchanges between participants and the AI facilitator.

### Custom Insights

The **Custom Insights** tab lets you add your own observations and analysis on top of the AI-generated summary. Use this to annotate results with your own interpretation or highlight specific findings.

### Files

If participants or you have uploaded documents (PDFs up to 10MB), they appear in the **Files** tab with metadata and download options.

## Managing participants in results

You can control which participants are included in the summary:

- **Include/Exclude toggle** -- Click on a participant to exclude them from the summary. This is useful if a response is a test entry or off-topic.
- When you exclude or include a participant, the summary will regenerate to reflect the change.

## Editing the summary prompt

You can customize how the summary is generated:

1. Click **Edit summary prompt** from the results page
2. Modify the instructions that guide summary generation
3. Save to regenerate the summary with your new instructions

This is useful when you want the summary to focus on specific aspects of the conversations or use a particular format.

## Exporting data

You can export your session data for further analysis:

- **Export responses** -- Download participant answers
- **Export chat logs** -- Download full conversation transcripts
- **Export summary** -- Download the synthesized summary

Exports are available in machine-readable formats for use in spreadsheets or other tools.
