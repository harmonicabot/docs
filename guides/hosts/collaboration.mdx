## Overview

Harmonica supports multi-user collaboration so you can share sessions and projects with team members. This guide covers roles, permissions, and how to share access.

## Roles

Harmonica uses role-based permissions for shared resources:

| Role | Sessions | Projects | Settings |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Owner** | Full control | Full control | Can delete |
| **Admin** | Create, edit, delete | Manage members, edit settings | Full access |
| **Editor** | Create and edit sessions | Add sessions to project | Limited |
| **Viewer** | View sessions and results | View project and sessions | Read-only |

The **Owner** is the person who created the session or project. Ownership cannot be transferred.

## Sharing a session

To share a session with a collaborator:

1. Open the session settings
2. Go to sharing or access settings
3. Invite a user by email or username
4. Assign a role (admin, editor, or viewer)

Collaborators will be able to access the session according to their assigned role.

## Sharing a project

Projects (workspaces) can be shared with your team:

1. Open the project settings
2. Go to member management
3. Invite users by email or username
4. Set their permission level

When you share a project, collaborators get access to all sessions within that project according to their role.

<Tip>
  Use projects to organize related sessions and share them all at once, rather than sharing each session individually.
</Tip>

## Managing access

### Changing roles

You can change a collaborator's role at any time from the session or project settings. Only owners and admins can modify roles.

### Removing access

To remove a collaborator:

1. Go to the session or project settings
2. Find the user in the members list
3. Remove their access
