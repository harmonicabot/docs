## Overview

Projects (also called workspaces) help you organize related sessions, track progress over time, and collaborate with team members. This guide covers how to create and manage projects in Harmonica.

## What are projects?

Projects are containers that help you:
- **Organize sessions**: Group related sessions together
- **Maintain context**: Keep background information and goals in one place
- **Track progress**: See how discussions evolve over time
- **Collaborate**: Share access with team members
- **Customize appearance**: Add banners, colors, and descriptions

## Creating a project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your dashboard">
    Go to your Harmonica dashboard where you'll see your sessions and projects.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new project">
    Click "Create Project" or use the project creation option. You'll be prompted to:
    - Enter a project title
    - Add a description (optional)
    - Set location or other metadata (optional)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize appearance">
    Optionally customize your project:
    - Add a banner image
    - Set gradient colors
    - Choose a color scheme
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add sessions">
    Once created, you can add existing sessions to the project or create new sessions within it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project settings

### Basic information

- **Title**: A clear, descriptive name for your project
- **Description**: What this project is about and its goals
- **Location**: Optional location or context information
- **Status**: Active, draft, or deleted

### Visibility

Projects can be:
- **Public**: Visible to anyone with the link
- **Private**: Only accessible to invited members

### Appearance

Customize how your project looks:
- **Banner image**: Add a header image
- **Gradient colors**: Set custom gradient from/to colors
- **Use gradient**: Toggle gradient background on/off

## Adding sessions to projects

### When creating a new session

When creating a session, you can:
- Create it within an existing project
- Create it as a standalone session (add to a project later)

### Adding existing sessions

You can add existing sessions to a project:
- From the session settings
- By dragging and dropping (if supported)
- Through the project management interface

## Managing project members

### Sharing access

Projects can be shared with team members:
- Invite users by email or username
- Set permission levels (viewer, editor, admin)
- Manage access from project settings

### Permissions

Different permission levels allow:
- **Viewer**: Can see project and sessions but not modify
- **Editor**: Can create and modify sessions within the project
- **Admin**: Full control over project settings and sessions

## Project summaries

Projects can have their own summaries that synthesize insights across all sessions within the project. This helps you:
- See overarching themes
- Track progress over time
- Identify patterns across multiple sessions

## Project status

Projects can have different statuses:

- **Active**: Currently in use, visible on dashboard
- **Draft**: Work in progress, not yet active
- **Deleted**: Marked for deletion (will be removed)

<Warning>
  Deleted projects and their sessions may be permanently removed. Make sure you want to delete before confirming.
</Warning>

## Nested projects

Projects can have parent-child relationships:
- Create sub-projects for more granular organization
- Maintain hierarchy for complex projects
- Track relationships between related work

## Exporting project data

You may be able to export:
- Project summaries
- All sessions within a project
- Aggregated insights
- Participant data (with appropriate permissions)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't create a project

- **Check permissions**: Ensure your account has permission to create projects
- **Try refreshing**: Sometimes a page refresh resolves temporary issues
- **Contact support**: If problems persist, reach out to [hello@harmonica.chat](mailto:hello@harmonica.chat)

### Sessions not appearing in project

- **Check project settings**: Verify the session is actually added to the project
- **Filter settings**: Check if any filters are hiding the session
- **Refresh**: Try refreshing the page

### Can't share project

- **Check visibility settings**: Ensure the project isn't set to private if you want to share it
- **Verify permissions**: Make sure you have admin access to the project
- **Try the share link**: Use the project's share link if direct sharing isn't working
