## Overview

After creating a session, you can adjust its settings at any time. This guide covers the key settings available to hosts.

## Editing the facilitator prompt

The facilitator prompt controls how the AI guides conversations with participants. To edit it:

1. Open your session and go to settings
2. Click **Edit facilitator prompt**
3. Modify the instructions using natural language
4. Save your changes

The updated prompt will apply to all new conversations. Existing conversations that are already in progress will not be affected.

<Warning>
  Changing the facilitator prompt mid-session may lead to inconsistencies between early and late participants. Consider making prompt changes before sharing the session link.
</Warning>

## Editing the summary prompt

The summary prompt controls how participant conversations are synthesized. To edit it:

1. Go to the session results page
2. Click **Edit summary prompt**
3. Adjust the instructions to change what the summary focuses on or how it's formatted
4. Save to regenerate the summary

## Session status

Sessions can be toggled between:

- **Active** -- Participants can join and contribute via the session link
- **Inactive** -- The session link no longer accepts new participants, but existing results remain accessible

This is useful when you want to close a session to new responses without deleting it.

## Visibility settings

Control what participants and collaborators can see:

- Configure which result tabs are visible (summary, responses, chat, etc.)
- Set whether the session is public or private
- Control access to the session link

## Sharing and invitations

### Session link

Every session has a unique link in the format `app.harmonica.chat/chat?s={sessionId}`. You can:

- **Copy the link** -- Share it via email, messaging, or any other channel
- **Generate a QR code** -- Useful for in-person events or printed materials

### Email invitations

You can send session invitations directly from Harmonica:

1. Go to the session's share settings
2. Enter participant email addresses
3. Send invitations -- participants will receive an email with a link to join

### Share settings

Configure how the session can be shared:

- Toggle public access on or off
- Control whether the link can be reshared by participants

## Participant question editor

You can modify the pre-session form questions after creating the session:

- **Add questions** -- Add new fields (short text, email, multiple choice, dropdown)
- **Edit questions** -- Change question text, type, or options
- **Reorder questions** -- Drag and drop to change the order
- **Required fields** -- Mark specific questions as mandatory
- **Delete questions** -- Remove questions you no longer need

<Note>
  Changes to pre-session questions will apply to new participants. Existing participant responses are preserved.
</Note>

## Deleting a session

To delete a session:

1. Open the session settings
2. Click **Delete session**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a session permanently removes all conversations, responses, and results. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>
