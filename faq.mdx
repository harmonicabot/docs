## General questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Harmonica?">
    Harmonica is a conversational survey platform for qualitative insights that enables groups to coordinate, reduce friction, and move forward together. It helps facilitate team discussions, gather feedback, and synthesize insights from collaborative conversations.
    
    Whether you're running a workshop, collecting team input, or facilitating a group discussion, Harmonica provides a conversational interface that guides participants through structured conversations and helps synthesize their contributions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does it work?">
    Harmonica works through **sessions** - structured conversational surveys where participants engage in guided conversations:
    
    1. **Session creators** design a session by defining their objective, what's critical to gather, and context. The AI generates a conversational guide (prompt) that can be refined.
    2. **Creators configure** a pre-session form with questions participants will answer before the conversation
    3. **Participants** receive a unique session link (format: `/chat?s={sessionId}`), fill out the pre-session form, and engage in a guided conversation
    4. The conversation is guided by the session design, asking questions and gathering qualitative insights
    5. After the session, **summaries and insights** are automatically generated from all participants' contributions
    
    Sessions can be organized into **Projects** for better organization, and you can use **templates** to quickly start common types of sessions.
