## General questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Harmonica?">
    Harmonica is an LLM-powered chatbot platform that enables groups to coordinate, reduce friction, and move forward together. It helps facilitate team discussions, gather feedback, and synthesize insights from collaborative conversations.
    
    Whether you're running a workshop, collecting team input, or facilitating a group discussion, Harmonica provides an intelligent assistant that guides participants and helps synthesize their contributions.

  <Accordion title="How does it work?">
    Harmonica works through **sessions** - structured conversations where participants interact with an AI assistant:
    
    1. **Session creators** set up a session with a topic, goals, and context
    2. **Participants** are invited to join and chat with the AI assistant
    3. The AI guides the conversation, asks questions, and gathers insights
    4. After the session, **summaries and insights** are automatically generated from all participants' contributions
    
    Sessions can be organized into **projects** or **workspaces** for better organization, and you can use **templates** to quickly start common types of sessions.
